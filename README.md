# CONTRIBUTING

Get Development environment up and running:
  - make sure you are using NodeJS and NPM installed, version v8.0.0+ and v5.3.0 respectively
  - install webpack globally with `npm install -g webpack`
  - (optional) install Gatsby globally with `npm install -g gatsby`
  - MacOSX + Linux Helpful Tools: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
    - I recommend to install `nvm` for managing node and npm versions, but as long as you have version v8+ or v5.3.0+ it should be OK
